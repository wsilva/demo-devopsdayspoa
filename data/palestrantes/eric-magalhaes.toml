minibio = "I have a strong background as a Systems Engineer for both Windows and Linux systems with some limited experiences with Software Development along the years. I’m lazy by nature and passionate about automation and anything that can make my job painless, therefore getting interested in topics like coding, configuration management, containers, CI/CD and cloud computing went from a hobby to an obsession. Currently, I work as a DevOps Evangelist at JobScore, where I’m architecting AWS infrastructures, taking care of infrastructure operations, developing pieces of automation, and helping build and spread the DevOps culture within the company. Besides my professional life, I like singing and playing my guitar, taking random pictures, traveling, drinking beer, cooking, eating and hanging out with my family and friends."
